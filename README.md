# coronascore

## Inspiration
We wanted a much simpler way to get raw COVID-19 data, and quickly compare with other counties. Trying to find sources for different states proved to be difficult and time consuming, hence forming 'corona**score.**

## What it does
Our web app pulls the latest data from the NYTimes GitHub repository concerning COVID-19. [link](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

## How we built it
Deployed on amazon elastic beanstalk, using javascript to code the functions.

## Challenges we ran into
We originally planned to do it all through python, but quickly ran into the not-so-simple task of calling python scripts into a javascript(?) web server. We began our research and redeveloped
